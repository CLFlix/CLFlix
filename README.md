I'm CLFlix, more commonly known as \_Kurookami\_ as per my Discord, YouTube, Twitch,.... I'm currently just mainly messing around with some small projects, like osu!Utils and keeping my Minecraft mods synced up using a github repo. I do have one bigger project, KuroBot, which is a Twitch chat bot that has a bunch of useful, fun and interesting features. 

Interests: Coding (obviously), Gaming, the Japanese language\
Main games: osu!
